Eventually I needed out, and I decided on making a career out of web development. Despite only knowing some basic outdated HTML and CSS, I wanted a new life and I wanted it without going back to school and getting a degree, or paying for a bootcamp.</p>\n<p>I see people ask all the time what they need to know to become a web developer, how long it takes, what they'll make, and so on.

HTML, text editors, and hosting most likely seem like second nature to many of us, but like everything else related to computers, it's not inherent knowledge, and it's a hurdle to get through as a beginner. I just happened to do it early enough that I wasn't even aware I was learning.</p>\n<p>Here's what I learned in that period, although since I learned by doing, I didn't know the proper terms for many things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An idea of what <strong>HTML</strong> (Hypertext Markup Language) is - the very first step to doing anything related to web development.</li>\n<li>How to view the HTML <strong>source</strong> of a <strong>web browser</strong> (Netscape Navigator, and later Internet Explorer).</li>\n<li>How to create and edit an HTML file with a <strong>text editor</strong> (Nodepad) and save it locally on my file system (Windows as my OS).</li>\n<li>Basic HTML <strong>tags/elements</strong> - text, headings, lists, tables, links, images, formatting (also blinking text).</li>\n<li>How to make colors with <strong>hex codes</strong>.</li>\n<li>How to use <strong>FTP</strong> (File Transfer Protocol) to upload files from my computer to a web <strong>host</strong> on the internet to make my website publicly accessible.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A few years later, CSS became popular, and I spent the next several years copying the CSS of sites I liked to make designs. CSS was revolutionary because you could do things like change all the colors of your links in one spot instead of all over your pages, having different sets of link colors, and so on.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How to use <strong>CSS</strong> (Cascading Style Sheets) to design the layout, font, spacing, and colors of a website.</li>\n<li>How to bring CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) files into an HTML file.</li>\n<li>How to create layouts with floats instead of tables.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Although I had been making websites for years, I'd never read a tutorial, article, or watched a video about web design/development. So although I was oddly competent at making a website intuitively from all the sites I downloaded and played around with, I didn't actually know many basic concepts like how CSS selector specificity worked, or ids vs. classes, how to use pseudo selectors, and I would often end up brute forcing solutions for things like positioning and the box model.</p>\n<p>This is generally the extent of everything I knew about web development before I decided to make a career out of it: basic HTML, basic CSS, basic managed hosting, and transferring files via FTP - everything I knew was static development, and I had absolutely no concept of programming. For anything that might be more advanced or dynamic - counters, guestbooks, blogs, forums - I used a third-party resource.</p>\n<h2 id=\"getting-started-and-internship-2014-2015\"><a href=\"#getting-started-and-internship-2014-2015\" aria-label=\"getting started and internship 2014 2015 permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Getting Started and Internship (2014-2015)</h2>\n<p>Somehow, it still didn't occur to me to really do much studying before diving into this new career. I bought <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=I8xhVj9qTUQC&#x26;printsec=frontcover&#x26;dq=html+xhtml+and+css+for+dummies&#x26;hl=en&#x26;sa=X&#x26;ved=0ahUKEwju-Zfa1ajgAhXypYMKHSEFB4EQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&#x26;q=html%20xhtml%20and%20css%20for%20dummies&#x26;f=false\"><em>HTML, XHTML &#x26; CSS for Dummies</em></a> from a used book store - which was honestly only a few years out of date at this point - and looked over it all. I was pretty overjoyed to discover that I knew basically everything in the book from my heuristic approach, but now I knew more of the technical terms.</p>\n<p>I was lucky enough that a <a href=\"https://hijoemartin.com\">bartender</a> at the restaurant I was working at was starting his own business and offered me an unpaid internship for a few months. So by day I did the internship and by night I cooked at the <a href=\"http://www.pacmanentertainment.com/\">Pac-Man restaurant</a>. At the same time, I was scouring Craigslist for some small jobs, and I created a few static Bootstrap sites as a freelancer. A lot changed since my early days, and here's what I learned during this time.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Upgrading Notepad to <a href=\"https://notepad-plus-plus.org/\">Notepad++</a> was a first step, which I quickly traded for Adobe <a href=\"http://brackets.io/\">Brackets</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/what-is-bootstrap-and-how-do-i-use-it/\">How to use <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, a responsive CSS/JS framework</a> - I found out responsive design was a new thing I would have to know, and I learned how to integrate Bootstrap, a third party framework, into my sites. I made a site about accordions at this point, and spent a long time trying to use PHP to set up a contact form on my Bootstrap site.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/you-dont-need-a-framework/\">The fundamentals of <strong>responsive design</strong> without a framework</a> - I didn't like how dependent I was on Bootstrap to create a responsive design, so I learned how to make a responsive site without it.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/how-to-use-jquery-a-javascript-library/\">The basics of <strong>jQuery</strong>, a JavaScript library</a> - Although I had no knowledge of JavaScript or programming, I began to figure out the basics of jQuery by copying and pasting snippets and code and hoping for the best - which I would use to make \"awesome\" effects like <a href=\"/parallax-scroll-effect/\">parallax scroll</a>. It was a hurdle to learn how to load a JavaScript file, load jQuery first, and other very novice mistakes. Eventually I learned how to make <a href=\"/simple-jquery-examples-with-code-and-demos/\">tabs, accordions, dropdowns, modals</a> and other common UI elements from scratch with jQuery.</li>\n<li>How to create several types of navigation styles without relying on Bootstrap - <a href=\"/responsive-dropdown-navigation-bar/\">dropdown navigation bar</a>, <a href=\"/off-canvas-navigation/\">off-canvas navigation</a>, <a href=\"/full-screen-navigation-overlay/\">full-screen navigation</a>. I really wanted to be independent of relying on Bootstrap.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/easiest-flex-grid-ever/\">How to use <strong>flexbox</strong></a> - I can't say I understood flexbox to the full extent at this time, but I was beginning to figure out how to use it in many situations that I had previously used floats.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/setting-up-a-brand-new-mac-for-development/\">How to use and and set up a <strong>Mac</strong></a> - I started using a Mac for the first time, after 20 years of only using Windows.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I have to make a pause here, because the next thing I learned blew my mind and is what really enabled me to start moving to the next level beyond making simple brochure-type websites: the command line.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/how-to-use-the-command-line-for-apple-macos-and-linux/\">How to use the <strong>command line</strong> (*nix)</a> - understanding that I could navigate and command my computer through the command line seems obvious to me now, but was revolutionary for me. I learned about moving, copying, deleting, changing permissions, installing programs, using command line text editors, <code class=\"language-text\">sudo</code>, and more.</li>\n<li>How to use SSH (Secure Shell) to login to another computer through the command line. This blew my mind as well.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/learn-sass-now/\">How to use <strong>Sass</strong>, a CSS preprocessor</a> - this enabled me to install and learn Sass, which was my initial reason for learning the command line. I learned how to structure a project, use variables and nesting, and watch changes to a file to compile Sass to CSS.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/getting-started-with-grunt-and-sass/\">How to use <strong>Grunt</strong>, a JavaScript task runner</a> - Just compiling Sass wasn't enough - I wanted to combine it with auto-prefixing, minifying, and other tasks. Grunt was the way to do that, so I learned how to set up a Grunt process.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/how-to-install-and-use-node-js-and-npm-mac-and-windows/\">How to install and use <strong>Node.js and npm</strong></a> - in learning how to install Grunt to compile my Sass, I had to learn how to install Node, and importantly, the concept of local installations. This opened up a whole new world to me.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/getting-started-with-gulp/\">How to use <strong>Gulp</strong>, another JavaScript task runner</a> - I quickly realized Grunt was convoluted and slow, so I upgraded to using Gulp.</li>\n<li>Programming 101 through JavaScript - <a href=\"/javascript-day-one/\">comments, varibles, data types</a>, and <a href=\"/javascript-day-two/\">comparisons, math, and logic</a>. I didn't know how to do anything practical with programming yet outside of my jQuery tinkering, but I started gaining a better understanding of the fundamentals.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/getting-started-with-git/\">How to use basic <strong>Git</strong> commands and make a repository</a> - I didn't quite understand Git yet, but I knew how to use four or five commands to use Git as a glorified FTP, and that was a start to learning about version control. I knew Git was important, but without a team to work with I wasn't exposed to many of the concepts I'd learn later.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"job-1-junior-web-developer---wordpress-2015-2017\"><a href=\"#job-1-junior-web-developer---wordpress-2015-2017\" aria-label=\"job 1 junior web developer   wordpress 2015 2017 permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Job 1: Junior Web Developer - WordPress (2015-2017)</h2>\n<p><em>11% salary increase from experienced chef to entry level junior WordPress developer</em></p>\n<p>It's great that I learned all that, because for my first real job in the industry, I was going to use practically none of it. No Git, no Node, no Sass, no Grunt nor Gulp, no command line, no Bootstrap. Just cold, hard WordPress. Nonetheless, this was going to present a whole new group of challenges to overcome and things to learn.</p>\n<p>A few months into my internship, I applied for a job at a different company as a junior web developer/designer.

I learned how to set up a local environment for Linux (or Mac, or Windows), Apache (the server), MySQL (the database), and PHP - a full \"stack\".</li>\n<li><a href=\"/setting-up-virtual-hosts/\">How to set up <strong>Apache and virtual hosts</strong></a> - I learned how to configure the Apache server to be able to run many virtual hosts at the same time.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/setting-up-a-basic-cron-job-in-linux/\">How to set up <strong>cron jobs</strong></a> in Linux.</li>\n<li>The basics of PHP and PHP tags - \"PHP: HTML Preprocessor\", as is what PHP stands for, is the most popular programming language on the web and the language most web developers start off with. I learned that if I started some code with <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;?php</code> and ended it with <code class=\"language-text\">?&gt;</code>, everything inside would be PHP, and everything outside of that would be rendered as regular HTML.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the longest time, I wanted to know how to make my OWN blog - not rely on Blogger, or WordPress(.com) hosting, but something I hosted <em>myself</em> with my own design - not someone else's theme.

That is how I felt writing this article. I tried to compile everything I know, but each new thing involved some previous knowledge, and that required previous knowledge, and at what point do I stop?</p>\n<p>I'm missing plenty, I glossed over more, but in the past five years or so, I've tried to compile and write about everything that has tripped me up along the way. I hope something I've written has helped you in your own journey, and will continue to do so in the future.</p>\n<p>I've written 123 articles about web development between my own website, DigitalOcean, SitePoint, Codrops, Envato Tuts+, and Progress.</p>","timeToRead":22,"excerpt":"I'm not going to get into the details of my story - in short, I liked making websites as a kid, but I went to culinary school and worked in…","frontmatter":{"title":"Everything I Know as a Software Developer Without a Degree","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAUCAYAAACNiR0NAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAADpklEQVQ4y5VUyU5jRxStbPI1rYR1BzpEKAjE4GfhATMZbCYzmXkGP9OAAAOBSLQBM0mA2LDiExBCQkqyIi0lvcuSGTVzuerm3ApEHSUQ9ZWO3quqW6fOHaqEgM3Ozr6anp52jY2NOdbX163T01Pn8fGxwcnJifPo6Mh5f3/vJCKD29tb5+XlpbWzs1MwPj7+Rjza3NycECB6NTg4+ABQZ2cnLSws0N3dHd3c3BhcX1+TlJL29/dpZWXF4ODggNi2t7epp6eHQPojE1ZUVHwhMHD19vZSY2PjQ21tbXJyclJdXFwoqDSASgVSBSLl9/tVeXm52tjYUGxra2vJysrKZCQSIUQXNjJHR0cdrAyEyZqaGh2LxTQINcgMQKhBqJEKzes4VG9tbWnw6dXVVV1VVaUaGhqelL4Ww8PDVnt7O9XV1SmcpjFJICSQGYDQhA01FAwGCT60ublJIKTl5WUdCASovr7+gTmgNCqGhoaslpYWwukKOdBQ/J+EUENYJyZ4IlxaWtJIA6uWzc3N1N/fHxG2bVvhcJhPVmVlZXpkZMQQorr/IIzH41RQUEAul4uVkdaaFhcXqaSkhBC2bGpqItTCFgMDAxbnAKcrLOpoNEpoCTo/Pzc4Ozujq6sr2t3dpUQiwapob2/PKJyfnyefz8epkAiburu7bdHX12eFQiGCOqMQp3EuCMr/Bo9ZOeeXgbyb+cd9DImwqaOjwxaojlVdXU3FxcVGIYeVl5f3L+Tm5lJOTo4B//Oc0+mkoqIi3itZSFtbmy26urosrpzX61WlpaWmKFNTU4T2IfTki2Af3uvxeCR3AIprC8i0eOBwOBT+NX2m4dqyYsnVR2Fs0draaqH7ORSFXtLJZNIk/P/A15FtZmaGsrKyJNqHUFxbQKaFUCk7O1uB3BByS/Am/j4H9mPDW0CZmZmS2weXwxaQaSGpPKnQnPrJ8SWyTwk5lxkZGZKLg0rbAjKtwsJCnlS4z/peJkkqTQ9JhPUMeI392CYmYpSeni5RVEK32AIyHR63mydVuLHhs4vyw+SETk1Lk27cIBQ3IiDTZaGf0t+k3bv9VfLdT0cy/suJfPfzsYy/APZbPPwoA522/Db19W2+w8G37S0r/Mbl8VJ+1veUWlhDYuI3ErEP+P7+1/c5sN/0H5QSjJAj8ztyewv54QiZNzEQrHT7i30jrlB7JCVxGP068T6akvgVeP+IT/+fxofRr1Y+RPPbxyN+n+dteSAYQh9/+SeK8DyRAoG5mgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==","width":150,"height":150,"src":"/static/44d44edae11c08be56cabe406cbd934b/4148e/floppy.png","srcSet":"/static/44d44edae11c08be56cabe406cbd934b/4148e/floppy.png 1x"}}},"slug":"everything-i-know-as-a-software-developer-without-a-degree","date":"2019-02-11T00:00:00.000Z","categories":["Personal","Popular"],"tags":["career","life"],"template":"post"},"fields":{"slug":"/everything-i-know-as-a-software-developer-without-a-degree/","date":"2019-02-11T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/everything-i-know-as-a-software-developer-without-a-degree/"}}}
